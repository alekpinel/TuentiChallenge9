# Solutions to Tuenti Challenge 9 by Alejandro Pinel Mart√≠nez

These are my solutions to some of the challenges for the Tuenti Challenge of 2018.

I've solved problems 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 11, all written in c++. The problem number 6 fails in one of the cases of the submit input.

I'm very glad with my performance this year because I got the position 56 and the algorithmic problems were very interesting.
